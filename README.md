# **Horiseion-Social-Solution-Services**
This is the main home page for Horiseon, a social solution service company.


##  **Description**
The current main home page does not follow HTML semantics and has repeative CSS selectors. I will be refactoring the code, while keeping the same format of the webage. The site does having accessiblity errors that I will be correcting to upheld accessiblity standards.


## **Tasks Completed**

1. Formatted the HTML to follow HTML semantics. Example shown below: 


        Before
        <div class="#">

        After 
        <section class="#">

2. Gathered CSS selectors that were creating a class for an existing element and calling the class. Example shown below:

        Before 
        <header class="header">

        After
        <header>

3. Correct heading attributes to be used in order.

4. Added more detailed titled compared to the "website".
